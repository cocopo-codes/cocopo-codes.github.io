👋🏻 Hi, I’m Coco, a storyteller at heart.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175722525?v=4" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 2%;" alt="Coco Poley, writer, illustrator, and programmer">

My work spans tech, pop culture, and creative writing, with bylines in outlets like The Mary Sue, the Stack Overflow Blog, and Anodyne Magazine. I love exploring what it means to be human.

I have loved weaving human stories into my writing, both fictional and non-fictional, for years. I’m always scheming ways to create a new story or writing a poem on a scrap of paper.

Thank you so much for visiting my creative portfolio!
