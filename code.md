From the TinyMCE blog to the Stack Overflow blog to the Lumen Developer Center, Coco has worked on numerous technical articles, guides, and how-tos targeted towards developers. Here are a few samples of their work. 

## GitHub projects
Besides full-time work in internal organizations' repositories for the last eight years, Coco has created a few projects of her own along the way. 

**Counterpoint**

Counterpoint is a downloadable word-counting local Vue.js/HTML application for writers. Within a couple of minutes, anyone can set up Counterpoint on their computer and have a totally private word count app right in their browser. [Click here to visit the repo](https://github.com/cocopo-codes/counterpoint)

**GetInsight** 

GetInsight is a series of handy Jupyter notebooks that let anyone quickly get the latest Mars Insight Weather Data from the NASA Insight API using Python. Users can export old NASA data into Excel sheets as data samples for any data project. [Click here to visit the repo](https://github.com/cocopo-codes/getInsight)

**dbt Test Examples**

Back in 2021, Coco wrote a series of helpful dbt test examples, since there weren't a lot of them online at the time. This helped her train colleagues and share what she learned, so others could use it as a resource. [Click here to visit the repo](https://github.com/cocopo-codes/dbtTestExamples)

## Tech talks

In October 2022 at [dbt's](https://www.getdbt.com/) Coalesce conference, Coco gave a 30 minute talk on how dbt can be used at the enterprise level, based on their experience as a Data Quality Engineer at WEX, Inc. Check it out ⬇️
